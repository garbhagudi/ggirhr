              GGIRHR intends to create a renaissance in training doctors and
              embryologists in the field of fertility. Since it is a part of the
              GarbhaGudi group, it has many advantages that are not available to
              other training organizations. GarbhaGudi IVF Centre, the mother
              company of GGIRHR, is known for its great success rates, ethical
              treatment, affordable costs, world-class infrastructure, and
              humane touch. With the backing of such a capable and robust
              organization, GGIRHR is well prepared to provide the best-in-class
              training to clinicians, embryologists andrology technicians, and
              paramedical staff to prepare them for the challenges of
              infertility treatment.
            </p>

              provided by senior faculties who are well versed in their field of
              specialization. Teaching staff at GGIRHR possess profound
              knowledge and are not just academicians. So the knowledge they
