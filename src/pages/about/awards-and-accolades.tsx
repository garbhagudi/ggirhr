            Dr Asha S Vijay’s GarbhaGudi IVF Centre bagged the prestigious title
            - “Best IVF and Infertility Training Centre in India” by the
            National Quality Achievement Awards in 2021. This is truly an
            ensemble award and a great honour for Dr Asha and her team, whose
            mutual goal is to serve their best to fulfill the couples’ wish of
            building a family. In the journey of treating infertility, Dr. Asha
            S Vijay realized the inadequacy of trained clinicians,
            embryologists, and support staff to treat infertility. This led to
            the GarbhaGudi Institute of Reproductive Health nd Research (GGIRHR)
            – a learning and training initiative by GarbhaGudi IVF Centre.

            To bring a revolutionary change in infertility education, courses
            offered at GGIRHR provide broad exposure to complex cases to gain
            experience in treating various aspects of infertility. GGIRHR
            provides its students an opportunity to work with senior doctors and
            embryologists to learn about different approaches used by the
            experts in treating infertility. The training faculty at GGIRHR
            includes renowned infertility specialists, and the classes are
            interactive with feedback from the training faculty. In addition, a
            cloud-based library provides access to a wide range of cases to
            enhance the knowledge and skills to treat infertility.

            Furthermore, during the pandemic outbreak, we adapted to the new
            norm of providing exceptional online training for a wide range of
            courses related to infertility and IVF. The courses include eligible
            training candidates in Embryology, Andrology, IUI, Ultrasound
            scanning, and much more. The ultrasound scan training at GGIRHR is
            unique among the few worthy ones available in India. This is because
            of our association with one of India’s best ultrasonologist – Dr.
            Supriya Seshadri. The comprehensive hands-on is provided on one of
            the world’s best simulators. Learning happens through on-patient
            experience with hundreds of cases that may be difficult to encounter
            in daily practice.

            GGIRHR believes in quality education with limited intake in each
            batch, making it easier for our faculty to provide utmost attention
            to every person. The comprehensive training provided at GGIRHR
            ensures students are competent and confident at the end of the
            course to consult and perform procedures related to infertility. We
            are also affiliated with IMA and RGUHS to provide practical
            infertility training courses and continuously strive toward sharing
            knowledge and training more and more individuals on some of the
            hard-to-learn skills. The glory of all our outstanding efforts is
            our recognition as India&apos;s Best IVF and Infertility Training
            Centre in India.

            We are humbled and extremely thankful to every individual who’s been
            a part of this journey and share the credibility of this success
            with the entire team of GGIRHR, whose relentless services made this
